Counting (Approx) Number Of Distinct Elements

Use -approximation
    -hashing


Si = int [0...n-1]
  ex. S1, S2, S3, ...

Hash Function h: [0,n-1] -> [0,n-1]
  ex. h(S1), h(S2), h(S3), ...

Need to 1. Keep track of small (striking) interval
	2. Remember the k smallest numbers h(Si)
	3. Look at k smallest numbers out of stream with t elements

S = biggest number in k
S = (k/t')*n  =>  t' = (k*n)/S
